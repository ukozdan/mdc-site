## About

A test site to experiment with all [Material Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) components. Utility classes are imported from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

Importing all the MDC packages and styles imdividually, as oposed to importing the single library package, has the advantage of excluding unused packages for production optimisation.

MDC leaves content styling to the user, hence Bootstrap utilities provide helpers to avoid creating too many custom styles.
